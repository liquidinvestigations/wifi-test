Here's basic proof of wifi setup, using mac80211_hwsim. Demonstrates
setting up an ap via hostapd (and the provided hostapd.conf), as well as connecting
to it via wpa_supplicant (using the provided wpa_supplicant.conf).

NOTE: the hostapd.conf sets the locale to RO. see conf_hostapd/ for a python
hostapd configuration module.

NOTE: this doesn't include any dhcp setup, that will be handled
elsewhere. this just proves that the hostapd.conf and wpa_supplicant.conf work
as expected

NOTE: to finalize the supplicant configuration for production we will need to
update /etc/network/interfaces to contain something like this:

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

you can use pytest for verification (test output follows):

test_conf_ap.py Installing mac80211_hwsim module...
Started AP...
Started supplicant...
TODO: verify connection via iw
.Uninstalling mac80211_hwsim module...

you can run manually as follows:

In terminal 1:

# modprobe mac80211_hwsim
# hostapd ./conf_hostapd/hostapd.conf

Configuration file: ./conf_hostapd/hostapd.conf
wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->COUNTRY_UPDATE
Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 02:00:00:00:00:00 and ssid "test_conf_supplicant"
wlan0: interface state COUNTRY_UPDATE->ENABLED
wlan0: AP-ENABLED

In terminal 2:

# wpa_supplicant -i wlan1 -c ./conf_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
Successfully initialized wpa_supplicant
wlan1: SME: Trying to authenticate with 02:00:00:00:00:00 (SSID='test_conf_supplicant' freq=2417 MHz)
wlan1: Trying to associate with 02:00:00:00:00:00 (SSID='test_conf_supplicant' freq=2417 MHz)
wlan1: Associated with 02:00:00:00:00:00

wlan1: CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED - Connection to 02:00:00:00:00:00 completed [id=0 id_str=]

In terminal 3:

phy#1 and for 'type AP' for phy#0
